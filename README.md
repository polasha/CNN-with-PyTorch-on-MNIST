Workflow>

-load training and testing data.
-Create loader
-make a convulution model, model follows- CONV/RELU/POOL/CONV/RELU/POOL/FC/RELU/FC.
-Define loss and optimizer.
-Train the model.
-plot the loss and accuracy
-Evaluate the test data.
-obseve the confusion matrix.
-Finally run the new image through the model.
